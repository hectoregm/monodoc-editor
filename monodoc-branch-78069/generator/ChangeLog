	* updater.cs: do nested types accessability right

	* updater.cs: fix nested types' file names.

2004-05-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@ximian.com>

	* updater.cs: close a stream that now causes sharing failures.

2003-11-06  Martin Willemoes Hansen  <mwh@sysrq.dk>

	* updater.cs: parameter type fullnames are disabled, 
	  this fixes broken links.

2003-10-29  Martin Willemoes Hansen  <mwh@sysrq.dk>

	* a.cs: Obsoleted and removed.
	* a.dll: Obsoleted and removed.
	* all.xml: Obsoleted and removed.
	* b.cs: Obsoleted and removed.
	* b.dll: Obsoleted and removed.

	* makefile: Reflects the removals
	* .cvsignore: Reflects the removals

2003-10-22  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* updater.cs (GetMethodModifiers): Return the correct modifier
	wrt. "virtual" vs. "override". This fixes bug #47016.

2003-07-21  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* updater.cs: Fixed indentation from the previous commit and added
	a ChangeLog entry.

2003-07-20  Joshua Tauberer <taubarer@for.net>

	* updater.cs (Generate): Add top-level parameters and return value
	section for Delegates.
	(AddProperty): Change check from CanWrite to CanRead.
	(AddEvent): Fix return value element.
	(AddParameters): write out RefType attribute if applicable.

	
2003-07-11  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

        * updater.cs (ConvertCTSName): Fix the logic for shortening type
        names.
        (AddTypeSignature):
        (GetTypeKind): Move the 'enum' case higher up, so that they won't be
        mistaken as structs.
        (Generate): Correctly write out the ThreadSafetyStatement with a
        proper <link> element.
        
        * makefile (update-docs): Added a new update-docs target.

2003-07-11  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* updater.cs: Fix the last commit by really inserting an
	XmlElement named "see", and not just a "<see ... />" string inside
	an XmlText node.

	* updater.cs (AddDocsParamNode):
	(AddDocsReturnsNode): Change it to write out a <see> element instead
	of quoting the type name. This should help document writing in the
	future. Less cut-n-paste to do, so on so forth.

2003-03-25  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* updater.cs: Fixed a stupid bug where the flag used to record
	'ref' params were stuck. This led to a clipping of type names for
	all params following the first 'ref' param.

	Also added a little more logic to make sure that '[]' is always
	preceded by a blank space. Hopefully, all array declarations in
	the XML are now standardized.

2003-02-20  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs (AddAttributes): New method for adding attribute nodes.
	(Generate): Handle AssemblyFunkyAttributes.
	(GetParameterModifier): Handle 'ref' and 'out' in parameters.
	(GetKeyString): Output a better string.

2003-02-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: a bunch of little fixes to deal with corlib.

2003-02-12  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: Now it'll only generate files if there isn't an
	existing file. Added some command line flags.

2003-02-11  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* makefile: cleanup and prepare for commiting the docs to gtk-sharp.

	* generator.cs: Put semicolons after declarations.

2003-01-28  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs (AddTypeSignature): Forgot to add the name argument
	to the formatting string. This fixes the TypeSignature output for
	non-class types.

	Also fixed BaseTypeName node generation for non-class types.

2003-01-23  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: (GetEventType): A new method to get the type of an
	event.
	(StartsWithVowel): Removed, it's stupid anyhow.

	We now generate the correct XML for events too.

2003-01-22  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: (AddTypeSignature): Added a out bool param to see
	if the current Type is actually a delegate and surpress generation
	of Member nodes if it is a delegate.

	With this, we now generate proper XML for delegates.
	
2003-01-20  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: More work on getting delegates to render correctly.
	(AddConstructor): Constructors don't list ReturnValue nodes.

2003-01-19  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: What was I thinking? Made it not use exceptions
	unless *really* necessary (like IOExceptions). Why throw an
	exception when you can just return null and test for it in the
	calling method? D'oh!
	(AddConstructor): Filter out type constructors (".cctor"), this
	cuts down our list of "CHECK ME"s generated in the output.

2003-01-19  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs (AddDocsNode): Make it add <returns> and <param>
	nodes if necessary.
	(AddDocsParamNode): 
	(AddDocsReturnsNode): New helper functions.

2003-01-18  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: Make it slightly nicer, it also tells you how many
	files were written now.
	
2003-01-18  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* generator.cs: Make it only show members that are either 'public'
	or 'protected'.

2003-01-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* makefile: Added.

	* generator.cs: Imported.

	This tool takes an assembly and generates ECMA-style XML
	documentation for all types in the assembly.
