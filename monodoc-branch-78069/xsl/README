statidoc 0.2

To generate the output on your machine:

0) Install the monodoc cvs tree.
	% cvs co monodoc

1) Install Sablotron.  Right now that's the only XSL processor
   that can be used (Xalan 1.2 has bugs, I haven't tried any others).
   	% apt-get install sablotron

2) Install the statidoc directory in the monodoc directory
   (beside classes, doctools, etc)
        % cd monodoc
	% tar zxvf statidoc.tar.gz

3) Apply the patches to the root of the monodoc directory.
   This fixes 4 small but annoying typos in the XSL files.
	% patch -p0 < statidoc/PATCHES

4) Generate the docs!  The -s says to make a second pass to strike
   out links to missing files.
	% ./generate -s

It should run for a while.  If it completes without error, your hot, new
docs are available in the monodoc/statidoc/output directory.
	% galeon output/index.html
