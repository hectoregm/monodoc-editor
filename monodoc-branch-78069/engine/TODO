Make Monodoc Tolerant to file changes.

	If the underlying file changes, resist the change by reloading
	instead of crashing.  

	Hard to do without making a copy I guess.

Add cut/paste to editor.

* Monodoc Manager:

	Show rendered text instead of plain XML.
	Have buttons to show XML, XML diff and text diffs.
	Have a button to edit the changes before commiting.

	Add a fullname entry for giving credit to people.

* monodoc ui:

	Add multiple tabs

	Scrollbar adjustment is not tied to the size of the matches
	list.

* Browser

	Add support for printing (requires GnomePrint# support)

	Add bookmark facility

* Ecma provider:

	Handle references to sample code, and generate a link in the
  	browser to use it.

* 2.0 Features:

	Add ability to mark regions of text, and save the 'mark', like
	TkMan did (highlighting the region)

	Add ability to add annotations to a link.

	Collaborative help: use a web service to pull comments from
	people on a given page.

* Ideas

	Keep a dynamic history of actions on a right-side panel:

		* Documents most visited.
