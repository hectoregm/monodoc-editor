2007-08-14  Hector E. Gomez Morales <hectoregm@gmail.com> 

	* Monodoc.Editor.Gui.mdp: Added DocumentActions file that contains the
	  implementations of the interface EditAction.
	* EditAction.cs: Added two methods to the contract of EditAction.
	  CanMerge tells if the calling action is capable to be merged with
	  the action passed. The Merge method does the need work to combine
	  the two actions modifications of the buffer in the calling action.
	* DocumentUndoManager.cs: Added ChopBuffer class that is like a buffer
	  the DocumentUndoManager uses to save the states of the buffer. It
	  plugs two handlers to the events of inseting and deleting text in
	  the target buffer and creates depending in the action and
	  EditAction object that will handle the Undo or Redo.
	* DocumentActions.cs: Class that contains several implementation of
	  interface EditAction. Added InsertAction that represents an
	  insertion action in buffer and EraseAction that represents an erase
	  action in the buffer. Each of this Actions handle the undo and redo
	  functionality.
	* DocumentBuffer.cs: Minor change.

	  class.
	* DocumentBuffer.cs: Added some small change for default handler of
	  DeleteRange event.

	  Monodoc.Editor.Gui/Monodoc.Editor.Gui.mdp: Changed name from
	  TestUtils to TestDocumentUtils.cs, added TestTextRange.cs too.
	* Monodoc.Editor.Gui/DocumentUndoManager.cs: Skeleton of abstract class
	  SplitterAction that implements the interface EditAction that
	  represents a given "action" done in the text buffer. The interface
	  request the implementation of basic functions like Undo, Redo and
	  Destroy for any Action.
	* Monodoc.Editor.Gui/Utils.cs: Added TextRange helper class, this class
	  takes the start TextIter and end TextIter over a region on a buffer
	  and grants helpful method to get the Text inside the region, change
	  the region bounds, delete the text in the region, etc.
	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs: FormaEnd is called before the start offset
	  of an element is saved.
	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs: Removed commented lines.
	
	  Moved AddNewLine method to DocumentUtils class, change old calls to
	  new arrange.

	  for DocumentTagTable class.
	* Test/TestDocumentTag.cs,
	  Monodoc.Editor.Gui/Monodoc.Editor.Gui.mdp: Added skeleton for
	  inserting test units for DocumentTag class.
	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs: Removed AddString and
	  AddPadding from class and moved them to DocumentUtils, the old
	  calls are changed to the new arrange.
	
	  Removed FormatEmpty method now FormatEnd handles all the formating
	  at the end of all the elements.
	
	  Some code cleanup when handling empty elements while deserializing.
	
	  Now in serialization we check that if a text is marked with
	  "significant-whitespace" is unescaped ie that the escaped newlines
	  in the text are recovered.
	* Utils.cs: Major hacking of utility methods for
	  deserialization:
	
	  Added GetAssociatedTextTag that is a method that takes a buffer and
	  a given tag then returns the associated text tag. 
	
	  Modified AddString method so after insertion of a given string in
	  the buffer with a "format" tag it terminates with an insertion of a
	  "format-end" region. 
	
	  New AddPaddingEmpty methods that insert a "padding-emtpy" region
	  used for empty elements conservation. 
	
	  New AddText method that handles the insertion of text strings
	  marking significant-whitespace at the start and end of the string
	  with the "significant-whitespace" tag and marking the rest of the
	  string with the given tag.
	
	  More lesser helper methods added.
	* DocumentTagTable.cs: Changed the name of method
	  InitializeTag to InitiazeDynamicTag so it represents better the
	  functionality of the method. Turned on the flag IsEditable for tags
	  "summary" and "remarks". Changed "remarks:Text" to an editable text
	  region.
	
	  Major change of editor defined tags: 
	
	  "padding" is now a region that is invisible and non-serializable
	  that is used to prevent merging of same tag regions.
	
	  "padding-empty" is similar to "padding" but is used for empty
	  elements.
	
	  "format-end" is a invisible and non-serializable region used to
	  terminate "format" regions that are visible but non-serializable.
	
	  "significant-whitespace" is a region that is invisible but
	  serializable that contains any significant whitespace that is used
	  to give format to text values in the XML document.
	
	  "stub" is in test status.
	* DocumentBuffer.cs: Changed the string that is
	  added when a editable text region is deleted.
	* DocumentTag.cs: Added IsEditable flag that
	  indicates that a given tag<->element is/contains an editable text
	  region. This in particular represents where we are putting
	
	  the "[" "]" symbols that surrond an editable region. Right now the
	  only tag that have this flag are "summary" and "remarks".
	* Test/TestUtils.cs: Added a bunch of test units for
	  the helper methods.

	* DocumentTagTable.cs: Changed some tag properties to help visualize
	  the documentation.

2007-07-05  Hector E. Gomez Morales <hectoregm@gmail.com> 

	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs, DocumentTagTable.cs: Changed names of some
	  tags. Changed from padding-invisible to only padding because we
	  don't want to user see this spaces that are used to get around some
	  TextTag behavior (ie empty elements). The tag padding-visible was
	  changed to a temporary name of "newline" because that was the only
	  character we are using right now to give format to the
	  documentation. A new tag was named format that represents added
	  text to the document to help the visualization of the
	  documentation.

2007-07-04  Hector E. Gomez Morales. <hectoregm@gmail.com>

	  TreeView.xml for use in test units.
	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs: Added GetArrays that initializes two
	  ArrayLists: beginTags and endTags. Checks the last item in the
	  array from the tags property of the TextIter. We only need to check
	  if the last tag begins or ends in the iter to initialize the two
	  lists. We use the dynamic tag padding-invisible to insert it when
	  we need some padding. I moved the dyamic creation of the tag in
	  DeserializeAttributes so the priority order is correct ie
	  Attributes < InvidualAttributes.
	* DocumentTagTable.cs: Added a new dynamic tag that represents any
	  padding that is invisible to the user.

	  because the major changes in DocumentTagTable.
	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs: Modified Serialize so that it takes in
	  account the suffix '#[0-9]*" that dynamics can have, modified
	  deserialize to create dynamic tags if the element is dynamic. To
	  minimize the creation of dynamic tags we try to reuse previous
	  dynamic tags that maintains the priority if not we create another
	  dynamic tag.
	* DocumentTagTable.cs: Removed singleton pattern because we now need a
	  table for each buffer because of the use of dynamic tags. I added
	  IsDynamic method that check if a certain element is dynamic. Added
	  CreateDynamicTag that expects the name of the new tag, initilizes
	  its properties, adds it to the table and finally returns the
	  created tag.
	* DocumentBuffer.cs: Removed the call to Instance, now each buffer has
	  one ad-hoc table because where are using dynamic tags.
	* DocumentTag.cs: Added IsDynamic flag that indicates if the tag
	  represents a dynamic element like para, block, SPAN, see, etc.

2007-07-01  Hector E. Gomez Morales <hectoregm@gmail.com> 

	* DocumentBufferArchiver.cs, DocumentTagTable.cs: Changed the ignore
	  tag for two new tags: padding-visible is for whitespace that is
	  need to format the document so is visible to the view and
	  padding-invisible that is need to catch certain elements and empty
	  elements.
