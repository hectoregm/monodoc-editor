MISSING

General features
- Support for base64 encoded structures (e.g. PEM);
- Use Mono.Security.dll for ASN.1 support [1];

GNOME version
- MRU (Most Recently Used) files in File menu;
- Update UI while downloading OID informations;
- (Optional) Syntax highlighting (reserved words);
- Separate strings from code for easier translation;

Other versions
- Command-line tool (with scripts for easier diffs);
- SWF (System.Windows.Forms) port for Win32;
- Cocoa# port for Mac OS X ? (that would require a Mac user of the tool ;-)


Notes:

[1] The current ASN.1 decoder class is included in the main assembly. This 
will change later when an "enhanced" version of the class will be included
in Mono.Security.dll (in a future version of Mono::). Until then the ASN.1
viewer doesn't requires a dependency on Mono.Security.dll.
